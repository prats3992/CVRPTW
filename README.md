# CVRPTW
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (CVRPTW)
To solve the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with restrictions on vehicle capacities and operating hours of destination nodes (Customers) as well as the Origin.
In this we will see how to use OR tools (by Google) to solve this problem in Python. 
We will also be addign a version of the code that utilizes Google Maps API and use real world places and plot the routes the vehicles will be using on the Map that too in order of visiting the destination nodes.
